###Code:

1. Make a cool pattern or character using Perlin Noise. 

2. Look at the VectorField example in the repo. We're setting the vectors in the field three different ways.  First, in a single direction, second, in a random direction, and third, with perlin noise.  Come up with __two__ more ways to set all of the directions of the vectors. Use a GUI or keys to toggle between them. 

3. Implement a 3D vector field and apply on it a 3D Perlin noise
