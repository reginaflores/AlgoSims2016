##Week 15 Homework: Final Project Workshop 2


###No Class - Work on your final projects!
  

**Final:**


Come to the final class with a full presentation of your project. Include slides that discuss the: 

*	concept
*	precedents
*	inspiration images/mood board
*	the main block of code that highlight a key algorithm that you use in your implementation

You will need to show a working app to prove that your code runs, but if you wanted to make a short film that highlights your work you can also present that. (Sometimes its nice to make videos of your coding projects and put them on Vimeo or YouTube to show the world your skills.) Be sure to credit any music you use. 

Include a core image in your GitHub repo of your final piece. 


Everything needs to be uploaded to your repos BEFORE class!!
