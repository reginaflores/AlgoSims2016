### Read

* [Chapter 3: The Attraction, Repulsion, and Spinning Forces section](http://gcc.bradley.edu/faculty/nelson-matt/IM460/Mastering%20openFrameworks-%20Creative%20Coding%20Demystified%20%5BeBook%5D.pdf) of Mastering openFrameworks: Creative Coding Demystified book by Denis Perevalov.

* [Chapter on Memory](https://github.com/openframeworks/ofBook/blob/master/chapters/memory/chapter.md) of ofBook by Arturo Castro 


###Watch

[How to Make a Planet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skYjWtm8r7I&index=31&list=PL4neAtv21WOmrV8z9rSzL20QpdLU1zJLr) by Lewis Lepton. 

[Making Gravity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-No-sODLbkQ&index=38&list=PL4neAtv21WOmrV8z9rSzL20QpdLU1zJLr) by Lewis Lepton.

[OFPlugIn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5obYVl8dhqo&index=44&list=PL4neAtv21WOmrV8z9rSzL20QpdLU1zJLr) by Lewis Lepton. PLEASE NOTE IT NOW COMES AS PART OF THE CORE IN OF 9.3 AND IS CALLED OFXcodeMenu- so just go to your addons folder instead of GitHub.


###Code

(a) Make an orbiting planet sketch. Get creative! I want to start seeing your personal aestetic in your homeworks. So show me your own style. You can alwasy include inspiration images in the README.md files of your homework. For extra credit, use a GUI using the ofxGUI add-on. If you don't know how to use a GUI go to the examples folder in OF and look at the 'gui' example (examples/gui/guiExample).  

(b) Make a particle system that uses repulsion or attraction or both. 

(c) Make a cool sketch that uses images or video. Incorporate particle systems in an inventive way using the concepts we have covered this week. Include some interactivity in the program.

(d) For the advanced student: Rewrite one of your previous homeworks (for example the bouncing ball) using pointers.
