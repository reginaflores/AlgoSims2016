##Week 14 Homework: Final Project Workshop 1

* Prototype 1 presentations

* In class code workshop



**Final Assignment 4:**

There is no class next week (December 8). The assignment is to work on a Prototype 2. You must keep a separate folder with prototype 2 so I can see your progress from prototype 1. Upload both of your prototype 1 and 2 folders to your GitHub repos. I will be grading this assignment based on the progress you make from each prototype. I will also expect to see significant progress from your prototype 2 to your final presentation.
