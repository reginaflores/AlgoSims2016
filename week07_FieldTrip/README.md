###Week 7: Field Trip to the OpenFrameworks Meetup

The meetup was held at [NEW INC](http://www.newinc.org/) and students were given an opportunity to be introduced to the wider OF community in New York and see work by industry professionals.

###Homework:
(a) Work on your midterm!


	* You will present your midterm project in front of the class.
	* You need to present a concept slide of your project. 
	* You may consider showing a mood board or inspiration images.
	* You must show working code.
	* Part of your presentation should include a brief explanation of some of the blocks of code that make up the "meat" of the application. 
	

(b) Make sure your homework 1-6 are complete. Make sure your repo is clean (i.e. you have 1 folder for each week) and you have a nice README.md file for your repo that shows each week - like a blog.
