# Setup

## 1. Download and Install openFrameworks and IDE

Go to [openFrameworks.cc/download](http://openframeworks.cc/download/) and download the right OF version for your platform. Close to it you will find a nice tutorial of how to install it. Please install the ```openFrameworks``` folder on your Desktop so that everyone has it in the same place ```~/Desktop/openFrameworks```. 

OpenFrameworks is essentially a toolbox, you need to become familiar with its tools. To become familiar with oF, you should spend a significative amount of time compiling, checking and understanding each single example.

An important material you need to read to know OF's folder structure together with your IDE interface is [Chapter 03: Setup and Project Structure](https://github.com/openframeworks/ofBook/blob/master/03_setup_and_project_structure/chapter.md) from the OFBOOK.

## 2. Install Git and this repository

On a Linux Machine you just need to type:

	sudo apt-get install git-core

But in MacOS you need to install a package manager like [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) or [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/). 

### 2.1. First install Homebrew 
According to their website you just need to open the terminal and type:

	ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"

### 2.2. Then install Git

	brew install git

## 3. Clone this repository

Go to your openFrameworks root directory:

	cd ~/Desktop/openFrameworks
	
And clone this directory

	git clone https://github.com/reginaflores/AlgoSims2016.git

You will see that the folder is together with the ```apps/```, ```libs/``` and ```addons/``` folders

* ```addons/```
* ```apps/```
* ```libs/```
* ```examples/```
* ```scripts/```
* ```AlgoSims2016/```

These will preserve the examples on 3 levels over the root directory (if you don't understand what I mean, read [Chapter 03](https://github.com/openframeworks/ofBook/blob/master/03_setup_and_project_structure/chapter.md)! seriously! READ IT! ).

## 4. Make a GitHub Account and a repository for your Homework

Create a github account if you don't have one already and create a repo for the class that you'll use to submit your homework.  Name it as follows, '[newSchoolID]_AlgoSims2016' (ex: 'florr422_AlgoSims2016' ).

* Your homework repo should be inside ```openFrameworks/app``` folder. Inside to maintain the “3 levels down rule“ your homework should be all in the same folder. NO SUBFOLDERS. You can organize it by ```[WEEK_NUMBER]_[HOMEWORK_NUMBER]_[NAME]```. For Example:

```
	openFrameworks/
		addons/
		app/
			[your_NID]_AlgoSims2016/
				w01_h01_blabla/
				w01_h02_blabla/
				w02_h01_blabla/ 
				w03_h01_blabla/ 
				…/
				…/
		libs/
		examples/
		AlgoSims2016/
		AlgoSims2016_students/
 ```

* Remember to add a [```.gitignore```](https://gist.github.com/ofZach/3707086). This will tells git to avoid certain files, such as compiled object code, .app / .exes, etc. It keeps your repos slim and lightweight and helps you avoid committing unnecessary things. (Beside [Zach’s gitignore](https://gist.github.com/ofZach/3707086 you can make your using [this site](http://www.gitignore.io/) ). Also you can use the one from the AlgoSims repo. For example, inside your private homework folder do:

	cp ../../AlgoSims2016/.gitignore .

## 5. Setup up the collective homework repo

	git clone https://github.com/reginaflores/AlgoSims2016__students.git
	cd AlgoSims2016_students
	git pull && git submodule init && git submodule update && git submodule status
	git submodule foreach git checkout master
	git submodule foreach git pull
