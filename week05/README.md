### Code

(a) Create a non-interactive simple sketch that uses springs in an unexpected way. 

(b) Create an interactive application with a GUI that uses multiple springs to create structures. Think about applying different forces on the springs to create movement.  

Advanced:

(c) Look at the 3D Springs examples in the class repo. Create a program that uses a Spring class and a Particle class and implement an interesting 3D structure using pointers.
